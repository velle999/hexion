            <p class="date">Effective Date: February 23, 2026</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Hexion ("the App") is a puzzle game developed by VELLE ("we," "us," "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Hexion handles user data.</p>

        <div class="summary">
            <strong>Summary: Hexion does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data. Period.</strong>
        </div>

        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <p>Hexion does not collect any personal information or data from its users. Specifically, the App does not collect names or contact information, email addresses, location data, device identifiers, usage analytics or tracking data, photos, files, or any other media, or any other personally identifiable information.</p>

        <h3>Data Storage</h3>
        <p>All game data, including your high score, game settings, and audio preferences, is stored locally on your device using Android SharedPreferences. This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third party. Uninstalling the App will permanently delete all locally stored data.</p>

        <h3>Google Play Games Services</h3>
        <p>Hexion integrates with Google Play Games Services to provide leaderboard functionality. If you are signed in to Google Play Games on your device, your game scores may be submitted to Google Play Games leaderboards. This feature is managed entirely by Google and is subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>. We do not have access to your Google account information. Use of Google Play Games Services is optional and determined by your device's Google Play Games sign-in status.</p>

        <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>Other than Google Play Games Services as described above, Hexion does not use any third-party analytics services, advertising SDKs, crash reporting tools, or any other services that collect user data.</p>

        <h3>Advertising</h3>
        <p>Hexion does not display advertisements of any kind. There are no ad networks or ad SDKs integrated into the App.</p>

        <h3>In-App Purchases</h3>
        <p>Hexion does not offer in-app purchases. All features of the App are available at the time of download.</p>

        <h3>Internet Access</h3>
        <p>Hexion may use an internet connection solely for Google Play Games leaderboard functionality. No other network requests are made by the App. The game is fully playable offline.</p>

        <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>Hexion is designed for a general audience aged 13 and older. Since the App does not collect any personal data, there is no risk of children's data being collected or shared. We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as they apply to our App.</p>

        <h3>Permissions</h3>
        <p>Hexion does not request any special device permissions. The App does not access your camera, microphone, contacts, storage, location, or any other sensitive device features.</p>

        <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by an updated effective date at the top of this document. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
